<h1>Israel's war in Gaza</h1>
<p>After <i>World War I</i>, Palestine was administered by the United Kingdom under a mandate <i>received in 1922</i> from the League of Nations. The modern history of Palestine begins with the <b>termination</b> of the British Mandate, the Partition of <a href="https://www.dummies.com/article/academics-the-arts/history/world/a-brief-history-of-palestine-186279/" target=_blank>">Palestine</a> and the creation of Israel, and the ensuing <b>Israeli-Palestinian</b> conflict.Israel and Palestine are at war. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel has ordered retaliation of the <i>attack by militant</i> group <b>Hamas</b>, that has killed around 900 Israelis and injured more than 2,600. Hamas, which says that it is <b>fighting</b> for its <b>freedom</b>, has also said that it will execute one hostage each time Israel drops an air <i>missile</i> without warning on its civilian houses and broadcast the <i>execution</i>.</p>


<p>According to <a href="https://www.dailyo.in/news/the-israel-palestine-conflict-explained-for-dummies-41885">Hamas</a>, the latest <b>attack</b> was in retaliation to years of <i>oppression</i> by the Israeli regime on <i>Palestinians</i>. Hamas spokesperson Khaled Qadomi told Al Jazeera that the international community must pay heed to the atrocities of Israel on Palestinians, “We want the <i>international community</i> to stop <b>atrocities</b> in Gaza against Palestinian people, our holy sites like <i>Al Aqsa Mosque</i>. All these things are the reason behind this battle.” In May 2021, a further round of <i>violence</i> erupted between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, in response to protests in East <b>Jerusalem</b> over the potential eviction of several <b>Palestinian</b> families. The ensuing violence claimed more than 250 Palestinian lives and more than a dozen Israelis, before Israel and Hamas agreed to a <b>cease-fire</b>.</p>
